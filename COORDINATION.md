# Coordination — Tino2 Inheritance Decision Project (integrated)

Repo: wingbangboozle1-lang/Tino2
Integration session: `session-arena` on branch `arena/1dab34fa-tino2` (PR #4 -> main).
Parallel sessions already merged into main: `arena/64131d11-tino2` (session 64131d11, PR #1) and `arena/7c9c2cc4-tino2` (session arena-7c9c2cc4, PR #2).
All work from both sessions has been preserved in this integration (conflicting files kept as canonical + alternates; see merge log below).

## Privacy rule (highest priority)
No personal information (names, exact addresses, contact info) may appear in the published site. Use placeholders (e.g. [OWNER], [TRUSTEE], [DECEDENT], [HEIR NAME], [PROPERTY ADDRESS], [TRUST NAME], [DOLLAR AMOUNT]). Any personal info discovered in research is internal-only and must not appear on the website.

## Number rule
All costs/figures rounded to nearest $10 in decision analysis and projections.

## Rules followed
- All work on branch `arena/1dab34fa-tino2`; push only to that branch until PR #4 is merged to main.
- Every table row carries an official source link or is left blank + flagged as unverified. Never infer or fill in unconfirmed values.
- Merge conflicts resolved without discarding the other session's work; handoffs logged below.

## Merge log (integration of parallel sessions)
- 2026-11-10: Session 64131d11 created board; repo was empty (README only). Research done; site built (index.html + pages/{tax-laws,properties,inheritance-process,projections,decision-analysis,flagged}.html + assets/style.css + .nojekyll). Figures rounded to nearest $10. Irregularities flagged: Property B 2018 tax +18.4% vs +2% assessment; Property A 2026 tax blank in source data; 2045 Prop 19 cap unknown; rental estimate for Property A unverified; insurance/maintenance are averages/assumptions.
- 2026-11-10: Session arena-7c9c2cc4 built a parallel root-level dashboard (index.html, cupertino.html, san-francisco.html, inheritance.html, taxes.html, decision.html, flagged.html, sources.html + css/style.css + docs/*).
- 2026-11-10: Session arena-7c9c2cc4 merged origin/main into its branch; conflicts in COORDINATION.md and index.html resolved without discarding session 64131d11's work: their pages/, assets/, .nojekyll, research/ files retained; root index.html kept from session arena-7c9c2cc4.
- 2026-11-10: Integration session session-arena merged origin/main into arena/1dab34fa-tino2. Conflicts resolved without discarding either session's work:
  - index.html: kept session arena-7c9c2cc4's root landing page; added nav links to session-arena's pages/* detail pages.
  - pages/projections.html: kept session-arena's version; session arena-7c9c2cc4's version preserved as pages/projections-alternate.html.
  - docs/executive-summary.md: kept session-arena's version; other session's preserved as docs/executive-summary-alternate.md.

  - docs/projections.md: only session-arena's version exists (no conflict).

## Notes on overlapping content
- Both sessions produced dashboards with similar structure but different projection assumptions (session 64131d11: 4%/yr appreciation, Property A ≈ $6,530,000 by 2045; session arena-7c9c2cc4: 3%/yr, ≈ $5,435,870 by 2045; session-arena: 3.5%/yr, ≈ $5,960,120 by 2045). All are flagged as assumptions, not official figures. See pages/flagged-review.html section E.
