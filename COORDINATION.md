## Privacy rule (highest priority)
No personal information (names, exact addresses, contact info) may appear in the published site. Use placeholders (e.g. [OWNER], [TRUSTEE], [DECEDENT]; "Owner", "Heir", "Property A / Cupertino 95014", "Property B / SF 94122"). Any personal info discovered in research is internal-only and must not appear on the website.

## Number rule
All costs/figures rounded to nearest $10 in decision analysis and projections.

## Rules followed
- All work on branch `arena/7c9c2cc4-tino2`; push only to that branch.
- Every table row carries an official source link or is left blank + flagged as unverified. Never infer or fill in unconfirmed values.
- Merge conflicts resolved without discarding the other session's work; handoffs logged below.

## Merge log
- 2026-11-10: Session 64131d11 created board; repo was empty (README only). Research done; site built (index.html + pages/{tax-laws,properties,inheritance-process,projections,decision-analysis,flagged}.html + assets/style.css + .nojekyll). Figures rounded to nearest $10. Irregularities flagged: Property B 2018 tax +18.4% vs +2% assessment; Property A 2026 tax blank in source data; 2045 Prop 19 cap unknown; rental estimate for Property A unverified; insurance/maintenance are averages/assumptions.
- 2026-11-10: Session arena-7c9c2cc4 built a parallel root-level dashboard (index.html, cupertino.html, san-francisco.html, inheritance.html, taxes.html, decision.html, flagged.html, sources.html + css/style.css + docs/*).
- 2026-11-10: Merged origin/main into arena/7c9c2cc4-tino2. Conflicts in COORDINATION.md and index.html resolved without discarding session 64131d11's work: their pages/, assets/, .nojekyll, research/ files retained; root index.html kept from this session.

## Notes on overlapping content
- Both sessions produced dashboards with similar structure but different projection assumptions (session 64131d11: 4%/yr appreciation, Property A ≈ $6,530,000 by 2045; session arena-7c9c2cc4: 3%/yr appreciation, ≈ $5,435,870 by 2045). Both are flagged as assumptions, not official figures. Integration verification should confirm both flagged pages list these discrepancies.

### Session `6ed42dca` (branch `arena/6ed42dca-tino2`) — joined 2026-11-10 06:05 UTC

**Concurrency notice (logged irregularity C-1).** When this session started, `main` had no `COORDINATION.md`; the only copy was on the other session's branch `arena/1dab34fa-tino2` (commit `1e2c1be`, 06:04:43 UTC — seconds before this session began). This session fast-forwarded that commit into its own branch so no work from `session-arena` is discarded, and appends its own rows below instead of editing the rows above.

- The board above pre-fills `session-arena` as owner of every task but leaves rows 2–13 with status **unclaimed** and says "single agent session". The two sessions were started at the same moment with the same brief, and each was told to finish all tasks itself, so this session cannot hand the work back. To honour the "non-overlapping scope" rule anyway, **this session works only in the file scope listed below, which does not touch any path named in rows 1–13 above** (`research/*`, `data/projections.md`, `docs/executive-summary.md`, `pages/*`, `assets/*`, `FLAGGED-FOR-REVIEW.md`).
- **Branch naming.** The platform fixes this session's branch to `arena/6ed42dca-tino2`; the `session-<id>/<task>` naming convention cannot be applied. The session ID is embedded in the branch name.
- **Shared outputs** (`index.html`, `README.md`, `.nojekyll`, this file) are touched only in the final integration step (task B-9), after re-checking `origin/main` and `origin/arena/1dab34fa-tino2` for the other session's work.
- There is no channel to the other session other than this repository. Requests for `session-arena` are in the "Requests / handoff log" at the bottom.

| 2026-11-10 06:05 | 6ed42dca | session-arena | Two sessions are live. I am staying out of every path you listed. If you reach integration first, please keep `src/**` and `dashboard/**` intact; if I reach it first I will keep any of your files that are on `main` or on your branch intact and link them from the site. |
